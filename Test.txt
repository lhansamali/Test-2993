 there are business services that cmdb shows to Bigpanda. But it shows Business Services which have appended with "syscode - System" but some of these  Business services are not in the CMDB table. We can't find which table that  BigPanda refers to fetch these business services with appended name.

Today we deployed new update set in sandbox.then I have executed cmdbloader script to check whether changes are applied.(pushed last 33 days data)
then I observed these:
 500 internal error for XDPS which has muliple records with same id.
Aplications which have isSystem=true (CodeTrack application) are pushed to both business service and Application service. Application name is appended with <appCode - APP>
 And wth the latest rapdev deployment, verified service offering record get data the same as the parent BS
